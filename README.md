Final_Project
==============================

This is the final Project for DTFF

## Codes and Environments
--------------------------
We offered two types codes for this project: Python and Matlab, you can run all of them and the environment setting would be given later.
### 1.Python Codes
We use the python code to implement the risk parity model in our report, while it would only give you the results of the model which include
the weights of assets and the net value of portfolio, all of figures in the report are drawn by MATLAB code.

### 2.Matlab Codes     
   We use the matlab codes to implement the same model as Python code, but all of the figures are
